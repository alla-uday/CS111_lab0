CS111 - Project 0: Warm-Up	Name:Uday Shankar Alla	ID:404428077

The following README file contains information about each of the following
submissions:
1)lab0.c
2)makefile
3)Screenshots a)showing backtrace and b) showing breakpoint and variable inspection

==========================================================
lab0.c
==========================================================
Program that copies its standard input to its standard output by read(2)ing from file descriptor
0 (until encountering an end of file) and write(2)-ing to file descriptor 1. If no errors
(other than EOF) are encountered, program exit(2)s with a return code of 0.

The program accepts all input through command line and uses getopt long to parse the arguments.
The program follows the spec in every aspect however ther is 1 small limitation of the program.

Limitation:Since the program read an writes using buffers, if the size of the file is
exceedingly large it can result in segmentation faults.

=========================================================
makefile
=========================================================
Makefile that supports the following targets:
 (default) ... simply builds the lab0 executable.
  check ... runs a quick smoke-test on whether or not the program seems to work,
  supports the required arguments, and reports success or failure.
  make check checks for the following errors as a simple smokescreen test:
       1)checks the case when no file input or output is given and input is directly
       taken from stdin and output is outputted to screen(stdout)
       2)Checks the case when no file input is provided but output file is passed as argument.
       Therefore input is taken directly from stdin and outputted to the file passed as argument
       3)checks the case when only input file is passed as argument.
       The output is therefore directly outputted to screen from the input file.
       4)checks the case when inputfile and output file is passed as arguments.
       did a simple diff test to see if the inputfile and outputfile were identical.
       5)Checks the case when an invalid inputfile is passed(the file didnt exist)
       6)checks the case when segfault is invoked as part of argument.
       7)checks the case when segfault and catch are passed as arguments
  clean ... delete all makefile-created files to return the directory to its just installed
  state. IT basically deletes all of the text files created as part of make check,
  the executable files created for compilation purposes, it also deletes .o and .out files
  created for debugging and execution purposes. It returns to the original state.
 
  dist ... builds the distribution tarball.
============================================================
Screenshots
============================================================
a)The first screenshot shows the segmentation fault and a backtrace done right after.
  It was pretty simple to achieve this. All the gdb commands I had to us were run and backtrace.
b)The Second screenshot shows the setting of a break point at the variable that causes the segmentation fault.
  Through the screenshot we can also see the inspection of the vaue of the variable which as expected
  is null.
